His father died before he was born and his mother died when he was six years old. He was adopted by Hadhrat Haleemah. Right before he was called to prophethood at the age of 40 years old, he was known as As-sideeq(he that says the truth) and Al-Ameen(the trustworthy). His first marriage at the age of 25 held between him and Hadhrat Khadeejah who was 40 years old then. His trustworthiness earned him the love khadeejah had for him.His honesty made him gain more followers in troops, the first battle he fought was battle of Badr where the muslims emerged conquerors.He never initiated any battle unless the non-believers left him with no choice.He was so compassionate to everyone that his generosity made him known to everyone.  He gave birth to 7 children and was succeeded by a child which is Hadhrat Fatimah. After his demise, he was succeeeded by four khalifas: Abubakr,Umar,Uthman and Alli. Abubakr was his close friend and he was part of the first set of muslims.</p>
    <p>His holiness üòç never kills or ordered the killing of anyone that blasphemed him even in his presence. His holiness instructed the muslims never to kill anyone that had surrendered and drop his sword on battlefield and told them never to destroy the non-believers property,crops,kids and their wives. He married Hadhrat Aisha lastly with her consent</p>
